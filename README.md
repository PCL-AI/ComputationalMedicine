# Medical Prognosis Study Data

This dataset is a longitudinal study of patient health outcomes, collected over a five-year period from a large hospital network. It contains anonymized records for a cohort of 50,000 adult patients, with the primary objective of understanding the factors that influence long-term prognosis. The data was meticulously compiled from electronic health records, lab results, and patient surveys, ensuring a rich and detailed profile for each individual.

The dataset includes a wide range of demographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of patient health. Key attributes include standard biometric data like age, BMI, blood pressure, and cholesterol, alongside behavioral and socioeconomic indicators such as smoking status, exercise frequency, and socioeconomic class. The inclusion of these non-clinical factors is crucial for developing a holistic predictive model that accounts for the multifaceted nature of health.

The target variable, Prognosis, represents the patient's health status. This binary classification, representing either a "Good" or "Poor" outcome, was determined by a panel of medical experts based on a combination of clinical markers and long-term health events. This dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and data scientists seeking to develop and validate machine learning models for clinical risk prediction, thereby advancing the field of preventive medicine.


The dataset has a total of 50,000 training examples and includes a total of 15 attributes:

* PatientID: A unique identifier for each patient.

* Age: The patient's age.

* BMI: Body Mass Index.

* Blood_Pressure: Systolic blood pressure.

* Cholesterol: Cholesterol level.

* Heart_Rate: Resting heart rate.

* Family_History: A binary variable (0 or 1) indicating a family history of heart disease.

* Smoking_Status: Categorical (Non-smoker, Ex-smoker, Smoker).

* Stress_Level: Categorical (Low, Medium, High).

* Exercise_Frequency: The number of times per week the patient exercises.

* Medication_Adherence: Categorical (High, Medium, Low).

* Socioeconomic_Status: Categorical (Lower-class, Middle-class, Upper-class).

* Mental_Health_Score: A score from 1 to 100, where a higher score is better.

* Diet_Quality_Score: A score from 1 to 10, with higher values indicating a healthier diet.

* Sleep_Hours: The average number of hours of sleep per night.

* Alcohol_Consumption: Categorical (Low, Medium, High).

* Prognosis: The binary target variable (0 or 1).
